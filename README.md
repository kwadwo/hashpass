# Hashpass

[Hashpass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hashpass/gkmegkoiplibopkmieofaaeloldidnko) is a simple Chrome extension designed to make passwords less painful. Specifically, it provides a quick way to compute the first 16 [Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) characters of the iterated [SHA-256 hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) of `current_domain/secret_key`. The number of rounds is set to `2^16`.

For example, suppose you want to create a password for `mail.google.com`. Imagine some secret key, say, `bananas`. Hashpass would compute the hash of `mail.google.com/bananas` and output the first 96 bits in Base64: `PFmEp+Uy0mv59Riq`.

Now suppose you want a password for `www.facebook.com`. You don't need to memorize another secret keyâ€”just use `bananas` again. Hashpass outputs `lq4wCR1FcrOteiHr`.

In general, it is very bad to reuse passwords. Hashpass generates a different password for every service you use, so your password for one service cannot be used to gain access to any of your accounts on other services.

A key feature of Hashpass is that it's stateless. Hashpass never writes to the file system or makes network requests. There is no password database.

**NOTE:** If an attacker can guess your master password, they gain access to all your accounts. Be sure to pick a password with enough entropy that it is not vulnerable to rainbow tables / dictionary attacks.

## Installation

Install Hashpass from the Chrome App Store ([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hashpass/gkmegkoiplibopkmieofaaeloldidnko)). You will then see the Hashpass button next to your address bar.

## How it works

Click the Hashpass button next to the address bar, and this will pop up:

As you type, a hash is computed based on what you enter and the current domain. Most often, you will want to select a password field first. Then Hashpass doesn't show the computed hash:

## Notes

- Hashpass doesn't store passwords. It simply computes a cryptographic hash every time you use it. If your computer is compromised, Hashpass leaves nothing to be stolen.

- If you find yourself using a computer that does not have Hashpass, you can just compute the hash yourself using your favorite programming language. For example, in Python, you would use:

    ```
    import hashlib
    import base64
    bits = 'domain/key'
    for i in range(2 ** 16):
      bits = hashlib.sha256(bits).digest()
    base64.b64encode(bits)[:16]
    ```

- If a generated password is ever compromised, you don't need to memorize a whole new master key. Just add an incrementing index to your secret key. For example, if your key was `bananas`, just use `bananas2`. If you can't remember which iteration of your secret key you used for a particular service, simply try them all in order.

- Some websites have certain requirements on passwords, e.g., at least one number and one capital letter. A simple way to meet such requirements is to append something like `A9!` to the generated password (and remember that you did that).

- Of course you don't have to use the same key for every service. But the point of Hashpass is that you can. Make sure your key has [high entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Entropy_as_a_measure_of_password_strength)!

- As with any good security software, Hashpass is open-source ([Github](https://github.com/boyers/hashpass)). It uses the [Stanford Javascript Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/) to compute SHA-256.
